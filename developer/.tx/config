# This is the configuration of the Transifex tool that we use to manage the
# translations on Wekan. Documentation at: http://docs.transifex.com/client.
#
# Push
# ====
#
# It is recommended that contributors use the Transifex web UI to create and
# edit translated strings. However in case a contributor has directly jumped
# into the code and made its translations in the corresponding i18n.json file
# we can push it using
#
# > tx push -t -l ar
#
# Where `ar` is the language identifier. In addition, the project maintainer
# should push the English source file to Transifex at least before each release
# candidate using:
#
# > tx push -s
#
# Pull
# ====
#
# The set of accepted language is directly managed in Transifex, the only
# restriction we define to bundle a new language in the application, is that its
# completion is at least at 75%.
#
# We use:
#
# > tx pull
#
# to download new versions of existing translations, and
#
# > tx pull -a --minimum-perc=75
#
# to download new sufficiently advanced translations.

# tap:i18n requires us to use `-` separator in the language identifiers whereas
# Transifex uses a `_` separator, without an option to customize it on one side
# or the other, so we need to do a Manual mapping.
