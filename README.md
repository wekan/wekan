Wekan is an open-source and collaborative kanban board application.

Whether you’re maintaining a personal todo list, planning your holidays with
some friends, or working in a team on your next revolutionary idea, Kanban
boards are an unbeatable tool to keep your things organized. They give you a
visual overview of the current state of your project, and make you productive by
allowing you to focus on the few items that matter the most.

Wekan supports most features you would expect of it including a real-time user
interface, cards comments, member assignations, customizable labels, filtered
views, and more.

Since it is a free software, you don’t have to trust us with your data and can
install Wekan on your own computer or server. In fact we encourage you to do
that by providing one-click installation on various platforms.

Currently you can install Wekan fork on the followin Platforms:

[![Deploy][heroku_button]][heroku_deploy]

Wekan fork is released under the very permissive [MIT license](LICENSE), and made
with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com).

Wekan fork roadmap is to first integrate existing pull requests, and then
plan for more.
