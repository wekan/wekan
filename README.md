[Bounty for implementing feature](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/wekanteam)

Please read [FAQ](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/FAQ).
Please don't feed the trolls and spammers that are mentioned in the FAQ :)

Wekan is an completely [Open Source][open_source] and [Free software][free_software]
collaborative kanban board application with MIT license.

Whether you’re maintaining a personal todo list, planning your holidays with
some friends, or working in a team on your next revolutionary idea, Kanban
boards are an unbeatable tool to keep your things organized. They give you a
visual overview of the current state of your project, and make you productive by
allowing you to focus on the few items that matter the most.

Wekan has real-time user interface. Not all features are implemented.

[Features][features]

Wekan supports many [Platforms][platforms], and plan is to add more.

[Team](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/Team)

You don’t have to trust us with your data and can install Wekan on your own
computer or server. In fact we encourage you to do that by providing
one-click installation on various platforms.

## Roadmap

Upcoming Wekan App Development Platform will make possible
many use cases. If you don't find your feature or integration in
GitHub issues and [Features][features] or [Integrations][integrations]
page at wiki, please add them.

We are very welcoming to new developers and teams to submit new pull
requests to devel branch to make this Wekan App Development Platform possible
faster. Please see [Developer Documentation][dev_docs] to get started.
We also welcome sponsors for features, although we don't have any yet.
By working directly with Wekan you get the benefit of active maintenance
and new features added by growing Wekan developer community.
