<!-- XXX Need to improve this introduction -->

Wekan is an open-source *kanban* board that let you organize things in cards,
and cards in lists. You can use it alone, or with your team and family thanks to
our real-time synchronisation feature. Wekan is a land of liberty and you can
implement all sort of workflows on it using tags, comments, member assignation,
and many more.

Since it is a free software, you don’t have to trust us with your data and can
install Wekan on your own computer or server. In fact we encourage you to do
that by providing one-click installation on Heroku or
[Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io) platforms and verified
[Docker](https://www.docker.com) images.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/wekan/wekan/tree/master)

Wekan is released under the very permissive [MIT license](LICENSE), and made
with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com).
