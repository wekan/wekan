[Other things that are not related to WeKan kanban](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/wiki/NOT-related-to-Wekan)

## Description

Lauri Ojansivu (xet7) has [trademark to WeKan](https://www.tmdn.org/tmview/#/tmview/detail/FI50202100052006A), as can be seen from bottom of official WeKan webpage https://wekan.github.io . Official domain is https://wekan.team .

Lauri Ojansivu, as maintainer of WeKan Open Source kanban, has added and removed about [4 million lines of code](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/graphs/contributors) to WeKan since December 2016. All changes to WeKan are at [ChangeLog](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/graphs/contributors). WeKan is used at [most countries of the world](https://wekan.github.com)

Lauri Ojansivu has nickname xet7 at many places at Internet, for example:

- https://github.com/xet7

Problem is, fake companies try to register WeKan these domains, or other domains that have these words:

- wekan
  - wekan io, virus page
  - wekan cn, fake spam company "WeiRong Holdings Ltd" and "Yongchen Holdings Ltd" trying to register
- xet7
  - xet7 cn, fake spam company "WeiRong Holdings Ltd" trying to register

Usually those fake companies setup virus webpages, or other fake webpages.

## Fake mobile apps that do not work
