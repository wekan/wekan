# Admin Panel / People / Login

Was the **Registration** pane of Settings. It is one **Login: Allow** group of
checkboxes: each is ticked when the thing is allowed, and each saves on click.

- **Forgot password** — the "forgot password" link on the sign-in page.
- **Self-Registration** — anyone may create an account. Untick it and WeKan is
  invite-only: the pane then shows an **invite people** box for sending invitations
  to chosen boards.
- **Username Change** — a user may change their own username.
- **Self delete user account** — a user may delete their own account.
- **Display Authentication Method** — show the method selector on the sign-in page.

Stored the other way round, because the fields are older than the wording:
`disableForgotPassword` and `disableRegistration` are *disable* flags, so the
checkbox shows the opposite of what is stored. Only the display is inverted.

Below the group:

- **Default Authentication Method** — what the sign-in page starts with. The
  `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD` environment variable, when set, wins on every
  startup.
- **OIDC button text** — what the OIDC / OAuth2 sign-in button says.
