# Translation audit progress

Audit date: **2026-09-12**. Last updated: **2026-09-13**.

| Status | Flagged keys |
| --- | ---: |
| Corrected | 10,530 |
| Restored pre-pull; awaiting validation | 4,059 |
| Reviewed; retained unchanged | 176 |
| Pending review or repair | 5,316 |
| Total tracked | 20,081 |

**Repairs remain unfinished.** Counts cover flagged findings; restored and unflagged translations are not certified as correct.

Fixes address wrong-language text, terminology, warnings, placeholders, JSON examples and calendar/search formatting. [Correction records](../../../releases/translations/audited-corrections.json) contain **10,617** exact before/after values, including repairs outside the audit.

Latest translation fix: **2026-09-13**, local commit `b53c48f822d7ab3a6c646d55df18837bbef7c4a4` — 18 French export/upload/file controls replaced with Walloon, preserving format names, byte units and field groups; **413 flagged Walloon findings remain**. Sources are recorded with the corrections; full grammar and specialized field terminology remain low confidence. Exact-value, placeholder, JSON example, HTML-tag/entity, key-order and idempotency checks pass; live browser verification is unavailable.

**Origin:** not all errors came from Transifex. The captured pull changed 4,061 values; the local audit added 16,020 findings. Bosnian errors already existed in local commit `bdb3b15886a749b725b5290ba0109fcba955f983`. Other ultimate origins remain unverified.

[Detailed evidence](Audit-Evidence.md) preserves the original categorized tables. Run `node releases/translations/audit-progress.mjs` for current totals; add `--locale <tag>` for remaining language findings.

After each repair batch, run `node releases/translations/audit-progress.mjs --update-summary` to refresh the date and counts from current local values. Update the latest fix commit and verification status separately, replacing previous batch details. Keep detailed findings and corrections in the linked records. No remote uploads have been performed.
