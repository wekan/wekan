# Translation audit progress

Audit date: **2026-09-12**. Last updated: **2026-09-14**.

| Status | Flagged keys |
| --- | ---: |
| Corrected | 15,555 |
| Restored pre-pull; awaiting validation | 2,208 |
| Reviewed; retained unchanged | 2,010 |
| Pending review or repair | 308 |
| Total tracked | 20,081 |

Review is ongoing. The [correction ledger](../../../releases/translations/audited-corrections.json)
contain **18,151** exact before/after values, including unflagged repairs.
[Detailed evidence](Audit-Evidence.md) retains categorized findings,
source references, confidence limits and archived progress notes.

Latest translation fix: **2026-09-14**, local commit `6eaabcaea` —
clarified the login-failure time window in Esperanto; retained 29 correct
support, accessibility and account-state labels. All **18,151** correction
and **1,981** review records pass. Browser verification was not run; no
translations were pushed. Overtime, lime-color, scrollbar, advanced-filter
and garbage-zapping wording remains under review. Checklist completion was
validated against ReVo komplet (`5b1ec70e9`).


Fixed categories include wrong-language prose, terminology, warnings,
placeholders and JSON/calendar/search formatting. All 361 originally flagged
Klingon findings and the broader 829 German-identical values were repaired;
the cron label retains the actual tool name Cron. Danish restored review
validated 611 values: 606 retained unchanged and five meanings repaired.
Four Danish context-dependent labels remain: free, Complete, Schedule and Days Old.
Esperanto overtime and lime-color wording
remains open.
Reviewed subtask actions/settings retain correct subordinate-task compounds.

Completion also requires reviewing all restored and unflagged values and
previous low-confidence repairs. In particular, 98 Tamazight correction
records have invalidated Moroccan provenance: CNAM MCΓ denotes Tuareg,
not Moroccan. Corrected source notes are not full dialect/grammar validation.
Calendar civil/astronomical epochs and moon-sighting distinctions, memory
and authentication diagnostics, migration labels, archive/logo terminology,
search-case instructions and full command grammar retain the evidence's
recorded limits. Obsolete migration strings remain in translation scope.
Veps filter syntax repairs preserve literal examples; Finnish prose still
needs full Veps translation. [Veps review](Veps-Review.md) records limits.

Placeholder, JSON and key-order checks verify structure, not fluency.
Preserve every English interpolation/format token exactly and retain correct
translations unchanged. No external translation service is used.

Not all wrong values came from Transifex: the audit tracks 4,061 pulled
changes and 16,020 additional local findings; some Bosnian errors predate
the pull. Correct-language human translations remain preferred. Keep the
full review scope open until language and browser validation is supported
by evidence. Requested issue #6692 awaits actionable LDAP bind diagnostics;
translation work continues independently.
