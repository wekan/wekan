# Translation audit progress

Audit date: **2026-09-12**. Last updated: **2026-09-13**.

| Status | Audit keys |
| --- | ---: |
| Explicitly corrected | 5,876 |
| Original pull values restored to pre-pull local values | 4,061 |
| Reviewed and retained unchanged | 94 |
| Pending review or repair | 10,052 |
| Total tracked | 20,081 |

**Translation repairs remain unfinished.** These counts cover flagged findings; unflagged strings and restored values are not certified as correct.

Repairs cover wrong-language text, kanban terminology, omitted restrictions and warnings, JSON examples, placeholders, calendar names and search/date formatting. The correction history records **5,938 values**, including fixes outside the audit. Flagged Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian, Slovenian (both locales), Latvian, Romanian, Slovak and both Galician queues are complete.

Latest fix: [7c8dc5591](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/7c8dc559129ceb92ebe15a2f441bc3f732bc6400), **2026-09-13** — eight Asturian member-mapping, storage and notification corrections. Repairs preserve imported roles without granting extra permissions, activity transfer, storage destinations and muted-board scope. **335 Asturian findings remain.** Meaning, exact-value, placeholder, key-order and idempotency checks pass; Asturian wording needs native-speaker review. Live Meteor browser verification remains unavailable.

**Provenance:** not all errors came from Transifex. The captured pull changed 4,061 values; the full-local audit added 16,020 findings. Bosnian errors came from the September 5 [local completion commit](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/bdb3b15886a749b725b5290ba0109fcba955f983), with no Bosnian changes in the captured pull. Other ultimate origins remain unverified.
