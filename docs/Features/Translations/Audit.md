# Translation audit progress

Audit date: **2026-09-12**. Last updated: **2026-09-13**.

| Status | Audit keys |
| --- | ---: |
| Explicitly corrected | 6,300 |
| Restored pre-pull values awaiting further validation | 4,059 |
| Reviewed and retained unchanged | 106 |
| Pending review or repair | 9,616 |
| Total tracked | 20,081 |

**Translation repairs remain unfinished.** These counts cover flagged findings; unflagged strings and restored values are not certified as correct.

Fixes cover wrong-language text, terminology, missing warnings, JSON examples, placeholders and calendar/search formatting. The correction history records **6,362 values**, including fixes outside the audit. Flagged Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian, Slovenian (both locales), Latvian, Romanian, Slovak both Galician and Asturian queues are complete.

Latest fix: [ddc2da32e](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/ddc2da32ed81b58d8e367df7d900d44a6fbd1d6b), **2026-09-13** — six Aragonese attachment-monitoring, storage-destination and transfer-limit corrections; provider names, positive-limit validation and saved-state meanings preserved. **248 Aragonese findings remain.** Meaning, exact-value, placeholder, key-order and idempotency checks pass; Aragonese and Asturian wording need native-speaker review. Live Meteor browser verification remains unavailable.

**Provenance:** not all errors came from Transifex. The captured pull changed 4,061 values; the full-local audit added 16,020 findings. Bosnian errors came from the September 5 [local completion commit](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/bdb3b15886a749b725b5290ba0109fcba955f983), with no Bosnian changes in the captured pull. Other ultimate origins remain unverified.
