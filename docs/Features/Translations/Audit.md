# Translation audit progress

Audit date: **2026-09-12**. Last updated: **2026-09-13**.

| Status | Audit keys |
| --- | ---: |
| Explicitly corrected | 7,874 |
| Restored pre-pull values awaiting further validation | 4,059 |
| Reviewed and retained unchanged | 175 |
| Pending review or repair | 7,973 |
| Total tracked | 20,081 |

**Translation repairs remain unfinished.** These counts cover flagged findings; unflagged strings and restored values are not certified as correct.

Fixes cover wrong-language text, terminology, warnings, JSON examples, placeholders and calendar/search formatting. The correction history records **7,947 values**, including fixes outside the audit. Per-language remaining work is available through the command below.

Latest fix: [a421875fa](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/a421875fa1258aeea33f2429ce539ae5b6f0a5b9), **2026-09-13** — two Aromanian search and legal-notice introductions repaired with low confidence; **three Aromanian findings remain**. Exact-value, placeholder, key-order and idempotency checks pass. Wording needs native-speaker review; live browser verification remains unavailable.

**Provenance:** not all errors came from Transifex. The captured pull changed 4,061 values; the local audit added 16,020 findings. Bosnian errors predated that pull in a [local completion commit](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/bdb3b15886a749b725b5290ba0109fcba955f983). Other ultimate origins remain unverified.
