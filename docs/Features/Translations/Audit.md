# Translation audit progress

Audit date: **2026-09-12**. Last updated: **2026-09-13**.

| Status | Audit keys |
| --- | ---: |
| Explicitly corrected | 6,026 |
| Restored pre-pull values awaiting further validation | 4,059 |
| Reviewed and retained unchanged | 99 |
| Pending review or repair | 9,897 |
| Total tracked | 20,081 |

**Translation repairs remain unfinished.** These counts cover flagged findings; unflagged strings and restored values are not certified as correct.

Fixes cover wrong-language text, terminology, missing warnings, JSON examples, placeholders and calendar/search formatting. The correction history records **6,088 values**, including fixes outside the audit. Flagged Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian, Slovenian (both locales), Latvian, Romanian, Slovak and both Galician queues are complete.

Latest fix: [b4091f521](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/b4091f5214cc65f53d938d309be1ecc9ca237d3c), **2026-09-13** — ten Asturian deletion, authentication, logo-link, subtask-destination and webhook corrections; irreversible-deletion warnings preserved. **180 Asturian findings remain.** Meaning, exact-value, placeholder, key-order and idempotency checks pass; Asturian wording needs native-speaker review. Live Meteor browser verification remains unavailable.

**Provenance:** not all errors came from Transifex. The captured pull changed 4,061 values; the full-local audit added 16,020 findings. Bosnian errors came from the September 5 [local completion commit](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/bdb3b15886a749b725b5290ba0109fcba955f983), with no Bosnian changes in the captured pull. Other ultimate origins remain unverified.
