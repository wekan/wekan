# Translation audit progress

Audit date: **2026-09-12**. Last updated: **2026-09-13**.

| Status | Audit keys |
| --- | ---: |
| Explicitly corrected | 7,756 |
| Restored pre-pull values awaiting further validation | 4,059 |
| Reviewed and retained unchanged | 175 |
| Pending review or repair | 8,091 |
| Total tracked | 20,081 |

**Translation repairs remain unfinished.** These counts cover flagged findings; unflagged strings and restored values are not certified as correct.

Fixes cover wrong-language text, terminology, warnings, JSON examples, placeholders and calendar/search formatting. The correction history records **7,829 values**, including fixes outside the audit. Per-language remaining work is available through the command below.

Latest fix: [0be8065e8](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/0be8065e899d54a86fe22b81df297b2d2822b9f8), **2026-09-13** — nine Aromanian user-error and filter labels repaired with low confidence; **121 Aromanian findings remain**. Exact-value, placeholder, key-order and idempotency checks pass. Wording needs native-speaker review; live browser verification remains unavailable.

**Provenance:** not all errors came from Transifex. The captured pull changed 4,061 values; the local audit added 16,020 findings. Bosnian errors predated that pull in a [local completion commit](https://github.com/wekan/wekan/commit/bdb3b15886a749b725b5290ba0109fcba955f983). Other ultimate origins remain unverified.
