# Veps translation review

Reviewed: **2026-09-14**. Review is incomplete; this document does not
claim that the remaining Finnish-seeded strings are valid Veps.

The registry names `ve-PP` **Vepsän kelʹ**. Its legacy `ve` identifier must
not be interpreted as Venda when choosing terminology sources.

Directly inspected [native MediaWiki Veps strings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wikimedia/mediawiki/master/languages/i18n/vep.json):

| Meaning | Source key | Native value | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Show | show | Ozuta | Direct imperative; full WeKan sentence still needs grammar review. |
| Activate | tags-activate | pane radho | Software tag action; adaptation to another control needs review. |
| Deactivate | tags-deactivate | kel'dä | Software tag action; distinguish disabling from deleting. |
| Enabled | default-skin-not-found-row-enabled | om lasktud | Direct state wording inside a skin report. |
| Disabled | default-skin-not-found-row-disabled | om kel'tüd | Direct state wording inside a skin report. |

The inspected source has no keyboard/shortcut keys. Do not substitute
its abbreviation term for Keyboard Shortcuts without evidence. Existing
`keyboard-shortcuts` is Finnish **Pikanäppäimet** and needs broader review,
even though it is outside the ten remaining original findings.

The enabled/disabled shortcut tooltips each contain both the current state
and an action that reverses it. Preserve both. The shortcut-list instruction
must open the list, not merely describe a shortcut.

Other original findings require complete native phrases: accessibility
information not added **yet**, accessibility page **enabled**, custom URL
schemes automatically clickable with **one per line**, **vertical**
scrollbars enabled, parent displayed **in the minicard**, and the sum of
fields displayed **at the top of the list**. Related Finnish vocabulary
or shared loanwords alone do not validate full Finnish-seeded values.

The advanced-filter description requires a separate full review. Preserve
all comparisons and Boolean operators, single-quote rules and escape
characters, left-to-right evaluation with parenthesized precedence, and
the exact regular-expression example. Lexical repairs cannot silently
simplify or omit these rules. Verify examples against English and the
actual filter parser, then run placeholder/example regression checks;
those checks do not establish fluency.

No locale values were changed by this review. Native terminology for the
full remaining labels, inflection and UI phrasing still need verification.
