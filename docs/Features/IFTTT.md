## 2a) Add new rule : Triggers
Currently, there are three types of triggers: board, card and checklist

| Board  | Card | Checklist |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| create card | added/removed label, attachment, person  | checklist added/removed | 
| card moved to |   | check item checked/unchecked |
| card moved from |  | checklist completed |


## 2b) Add new rule : Actions
For every trigger, there are 4 types of actions: board, card, checklist and mail

| Board  | Card | Checklist | Mail |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| move card to list | add/remove label, attachment, person  | checklist add/remove | send email to |
| move to top/bottom | set title/description | check/uncheck item | |
| archive/unarchive |  | checklist complete | |


# Example : How the rule works
* Rule 1: When a card is added to the board -> Add label yellow
* Rule 2: When a card is moved to List 2 -> Add checklist ToDo
* Rule 3: When a card is added to List 1 -> Add label blue
