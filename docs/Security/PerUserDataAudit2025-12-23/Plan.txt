Per-User vs Per-Board saving of data: Audit Plan 2025-12-23

All collapse state and swimlane height and list width is per-user and should always be persisted at users profile and localstorage, and validated that there is only numbers etc valid data. Invalid data and expired data is deleted from localstorage. swimlane height, list width and collapsed state need to be removed from board level, they are only user level. save swimlaneId always when saving data when swimlaneId is available. If there is no swimlaneId, show not-visible data at rescued data swimlane, similar like there is board settings / migrations to make invisible cards visible, by adding missing data. save position history to each user profile, and have undo redo buttons and list of history savepoints where is possible to return, similar like existing activities data schema, but no overwriting history. for board-level data, for each field (like description, comments etc) at Search All Boards have translateable options to also search from history of boards where user is member of board
